## ⚙️ Installation

- First, you need to clone this repository: <br />
  `git clone https://github.com/gasampaiosouza/notes` <br /><br />
  or you can use [hub](https://hub.github.com/) with: <br />
  `hub clone gasampaiosouza/notes`

  <br />

- Then, go into the folder you've created and open it <br />
  `cd notes && code .`
  > **code dot** is for VSCode

<br />

- Then you can run it the way you want! Via **live-server**, **lite-server**, or even with the vanilla **html**.
  > Do not forget to **compile** SASS.

## 🔨 Tools
